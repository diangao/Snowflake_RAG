       "['As the need to vomit is perceived, the cat appears anxious and may seek attention and reassurance. You will also see the cat begin to salivate and make repeated efforts to swallow.As vomiting starts, a simultaneous contraction of the muscles of the stom- ach and abdominal wall occurs. This leads to an abrupt buildup in intra- abdominal pressure. At the same time, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes. The stomach contents travel up the esophagus and out the mouth. As the cat vomits, it extends its neck and makes a harsh gagging sound. This sequence should be distinguished from the passive act of regurgitation described earlier.\\\\n## CAUSES OF VOMITING\\\\nThe most common cause of vomiting is swallowing hair or some other indi gestible foreign material, such as grass, that is irritating to the stomach. Most cats experience this at one time or another. Intestinal parasites may also cause stomach irritation. Other common causes are overeating or eating too fast. When kittens gobble their food and exercise immediately thereafter, they are likely to vomit. This kind of vomiting is not serious. It may be the result of feeding several kittens from a single pan, which encourages rapid eating. Separating kittens or feeding smaller meals often eliminates this problem. (For more on vomiting in kittens, see chapter 17.)If the cat vomits once or twice but appears perfectly normal before and after, the problem is not serious and can be treated at home (see Home Treatment of Vomiting, page 269).

(For more on vomiting in kittens, see chapter 17.)If the cat vomits once or twice but appears perfectly normal before and after, the problem is not serious and can be treated at home (see Home Treatment of Vomiting, page 269). Vomiting unrelated to eating is frequently a\\\\n# 268 : CAT OWNER's HOME VETERINARY HANDBOOK\\\\nsign of an infectious disease, kidney or liver disease, or a central nervous sys- tem disorder. Diseases frequently associated with vomiting include feline pan leukopenia, tonsillitis, sore throat, inflammatory bowel disease, and infected uterus (acute metritis). Other signs of illness will be present. In young cats, sudden vomiting with fever is suspicious of panleukopenia.Another serious cause of vomiting is ingesting poison or a drug. Poisons are discussed on page 26. A most serious cause of vomiting is associated with peri- tonitis. This is an emergency. Causes are discussed in Painful Abdomen (page 15).It is often possible to understand your cat's problem by noticing how and when he vomits. Note whether it is repeated, and if so, whether it is sporadic or persistent. How soon after eating does it occur? Is it projectile? Inspect the vomitus for blood, fecal material, and foreign objects.\\\\n## Persistent Vomiting\\\\nThe cat vomits, then continues to retch, bringing up a frothy, clear fluid. This suggests spoiled food, grass, hairballs, other indigestibles, and certain diseases such as infectious enteritis, which irritate the stomach lining. If the vomiting is\",\n",

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be given only under veterinary supervision.Finally, if there is no apparent explanation for the sporadic vomiting, the cat may be suffering from an internal disorder such as liver disease, kidney fail ure, diabetes, tonsillitis, infected uterus, pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism, irrita- ble bowel disease, or heartworm disease. The bacteria Helicobacter pyloris (see page 74) is a possible cause of chronic gastritis.Treatment: This depends on finding and correcting the underlying cause. A cat with chronic vomiting should be examined by a veterinarian. Special diagnostic studies may be required. These may include a biopsy of the stomach or intestine by endoscopy, special dye studies with X-rays, or ultrasound exami- nations. Blood work is usually needed to rule out certain diseases. Cats with chronic vomiting often require a special, customized diet to fit the particular disease causing the vomiting. Famotidine (Pepcid) may be helpful.\\\\n## FOOD INTOLERANCE\\\\nSome cats are unable to tolerate certain foods or specific brands of commer- cial cat food. This is determined by trial and error. Food hypersensitivity or intolerance could be the problem if your cat vomits about two hours after eat ing. Grains, especially wheat and corn, are common culprits. Cats may also develop an intolerance to a specific protein source, such as chicken or fish.',\n",

Since vomiting is so common in cats, it will be discussed in a separate section (see page 267).\\\\n## ACUTE GASTRITIS\\\\nGastritis is an irritation of the lining of the stomach that comes on suddenly. The principal sign is severe and continuous vomiting. Acute gastritis is severe and continuous vomiting that comes on suddenly. It is most likely caused by swallowing an irritant or a poison. Common stomach irritants include grass and other plants, hair, bones, spoiled food, and garbage. Certain drugs, notably aspirin, but also cortisone, butazolidin, and some antibiotics, produce gastric irritation. Common poisons include antifreeze, fertilizers, plant toxins, crabgrass killers, and rat poisons. If any of these is suspected, notify your vet- erinarian.A cat with an acute gastritis vomits shortly after eating and later stops eat- ing altogether and appears lethargic, sitting with his head hanging over the water bowl. His temperature remains normal unless the cat has an acute enteritis, a disease that also causes diarrhea.Keep in mind that persistent vomiting is also associated with life-threaten- ing diseases such as intestinal obstruction and peritonitis.

Specific antidotes are available from your veterinarian, who can also do blood tests to determine the lead levels\\\\n# CORROSIVE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS\\\\nCorrosive and caustic chemicals (acids and alkalis) are found in household cleaners, dishwasher detergents, toilet bowl cleaners, drain decloggers, and commercial solvents. When ingested, they cause burns of the mouth, esopha gus, and stomach. Severe cases are associated with acute perforation of the esophagus and stomach. Later, strictures of these organs may develop from tissue damage and scarring. Even simply walking through a phenolic disinfectant solu- tion, such as Lysol, can be dangerous for cats, especially if they lick their feet to clean them.Treatment: Do not induce vomiting! Vomiting will simply double the tissue damage. Rinse out your cat's mouth-under a running faucet, if possible, or with a hose. Contact your veterinarian following any exposures to these products.The practice of giving an acid to neutralize an alkali, and vice versa, is no longer recommended because it causes heat injury to the lining of the stomach.If these products get on the cat's skin, prevent him from licking or groom- ing and flush the area thoroughly for at least 10 to 30 minutes with running water.\\\\n## GARBAGE AND FOOD POISONS\\\\nCats are more particular than dogs about what they eat.\", \"defects, 474-477 fading kitten syndrome and, 460|Creatinine, 570 Creeping eruption (cutaneous larvae|\\\\n|of the kidneys, 379|Cremation, 544|\\\\n|Congenital hypotrichosis, 131|Cross-eyed gaze (strabismus), 177|\\\\n|Congenital megaesophagus, 261262|Croupy breathing, 298|\\\\n|Congestive heart failure, 327|Cruciate, ruptured (torn knee ligament),|\\\\n\\\\n|Crying (meowing), kittens, 455|Dehydration, 22, 82, 220, 272, 275-277,|\\\\n| :---: | :---: |\\\\n|Cryosurgery, 518|304,375|\\\\n|Cryotherapy, 519|kidney failure and, 377, 378|\\\\n|Cryptococcosis, 98-99, 201, 228|in kittens, 459, 464, 466, 469, 470|\\\\n|Cryptococcus infection, 228|vomiting and, 269|\\\\n|Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles), 415, 421|Delivery.

If inflammatory bowel disease is also involved, the cat may need immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone.Ursodeoxycholic acid (Actigall) is a human medication that has been used off-label in cats with cholangiohepatitis, and is important as an anti-inflam- matory as well as for improving bile flow.Survival rate is about 50 percent-higher if the cat is diagnosed and treated aggressively early in the course of the disease. This often includes sup- plemental feeding through a tube.\\\\n## PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT\\\\nA portosystemic shunt is an inherited anatomical defect that is present at birth. In a normal kitten or cat, food is eaten and digested, then absorbed through the intestines into a large vein called the portal vein. This vein carries digestive products to the liver, where nutrients are metabolized, detoxified, and used to create new substances. In cats with portosystemic shunt, an abnormal portal vein bypasses the liver and takes blood directly to the heart. This means the nutrients and waste products are not processed by the liver. Ammonia products build up in the cat's system and many behavioral abnormalities may be seen such as circling, head pressing, or seizures (see Hepatic Lipidosis, page 288). Weight loss, excessive drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea may be seen.  \\\\nTHE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM : 291Diagnosis is done via blood work and looking at special X-ray\", 'box is getting dirty faster. This large urine output must be compensated for by increased fluid intake, and the cat will drink a lot more than usual. Also, because the urine is dilute (not concentrated), bacterial infections of the bladder and kidneys are much more common.As renal function continues to deteriorate, the cat begins to retain ammonia, nitrogen, acids, and other waste products in the bloodstream and tissues (ure- mic poisoning). Blood chemistries will determine the exact levels of these metabolic products. Cats in the later stages of kidney failure may produce less urine than normal and, eventually, no urine at all, which leads to rapid declineSigns of uremia include apathy and sluggishness, loss of appetite and weight, dry haircoat, a brownish discoloration to the surface of the tongue, and ulcers on the gums and tongue. The breath may have an ammonialike odor. Vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Eventually, the cat falls into a coma and dies.Diagnosing kidney failure may require a number of techniques. X-rays, with or without dye studies, along with ultrasound evaluations, can be impor- tant. Blood work, especially blood chemistry panels that look for toxic waste levels in the blood, should be done. Many cats will show increased levels of BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, and phosphorus. Anemia will show up in cats with chronic renal failure.A urinalysis will show if the kidneys can still filter and concentrate the urine.']\n",
      "Based on the provided context, if your cat is lethargic and vomiting, you should seek immediate medical attention from your veterinarian. These symptoms can be signs of various serious conditions, including kidney failure or poisoning. It's crucial to have your cat examined by a professional to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.\n"
